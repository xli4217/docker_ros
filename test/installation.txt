1. apt-get update unable to resolve: https://development.robinwinslow.uk/2016/06/23/fix-docker-networking-dns/


2. For nvidia driver/hardware acceleration issues: https://github.com/facontidavide/ros-docker-gazebo

3. need to pull nvidia image same version setup as host: (for driver) sudo apt-get install nvidia-370 (or find your version through nvidia-smi)

4. might need the right version of cuda: sudo apt-get install nvidia/cuda:8.0-cudnn7-runtime-ubuntu16.04

5. nvidia-docker2 doesn't work with gazebo/rviz at the moment http://wiki.ros.org/docker/Tutorials/Hardware%20Acceleration

6. after sudo apt-get install nvidia-docker nvidia-mdprobe, run sudo service nvidia-docker start

7. can also consider connecting from host to container through gzclient https://hub.docker.com/_/gazebo/
